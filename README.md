# ⚡ Electricity Demand Forecasting Dashboard ⚡

**An interactive Streamlit dashboard that forecasts electricity demand using time-series analysis and machine learning models like XGBoost.**

</div>

This project provides an end-to-end solution for time-series forecasting, allowing users to upload their own data, visualize predictions from multiple models, and evaluate their performance using key metrics. It serves as a powerful demonstration of applying data science to solve real-world energy management challenges.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The dashboard follows a systematic process to deliver accurate forecasts:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The user can either use the default dataset (hourly electricity consumption for the UK) or upload their own CSV file.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** The application automatically generates a rich set of features from the timestamp, which are crucial for the models to identify patterns:
    * **Time-Based Features:** Hour, Day of the week, Day of the year, Month, Year.
    * **Lag Features:** Demand from the previous hour, 24 hours ago (previous day), and 168 hours ago (previous week).
    * **Rolling Window Features:** Rolling mean of demand over the past 24 hours.
3.  **Model Training:** The data is split into training and testing sets. The selected model (Naïve, Linear Regression, or XGBoost) is then trained on the historical data.
4.  **Forecasting & Evaluation:** The trained model predicts future demand. The predictions are then compared against the actual values in the test set, and performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) are calculated and displayed.
5.  **Visualization:** The actual demand and the model's predictions are plotted on an interactive chart, making it easy to see how well the model performs.
